Roadmap ensures you dominate both traditional search engines (SEO) and LLM/RAG-based discovery systems (RAO) — meaning your platform’s content will appear on Google, AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini, and other AI-powered discovery engines.

RAO (Retrieval-Augmented Optimization) Tasks

These add five more layers focused on how LLMs retrieve, rank, and cite your content.


TASK 11 — RAO Content Structuring & Chunking System

Goal: Make content retrievable by LLMs as clean semantic chunks.
Do:
Divide articles into 200–400-word “context blocks” with headers
Use consistent structure: Question → Context → Facts → Source Links
Add “canonical answer” summary paragraphs at top of each post
Include short FAQ and glossary blocks inside each post

🧩 Outcome:
LLMs retrieve precise, factual chunks from your site as context.


TASK 12 — Semantic Embedding & Vector Index Setup

Goal: Make your platform embedding-ready for AI crawlers & RAG retrievers.
Do:

Create a vector index of all articles using embeddings (OpenAI, Cohere, or local model)
Generate hybrid index (keyword + embedding) for internal search and API exposure
Optimize embeddings for entity recognition (coins, protocols, projects)
Auto-refresh embeddings when articles update

🧩 Outcome:
Your site is machine-readable and retrievable by any RAG/LLM system.


TASK 13 — Knowledge API & LLM Access Layer

Goal: Let AI agents directly access and cite your verified data.
Do:
Build public knowledge API exposing summaries, definitions, latest stats
Create developer endpoints for “latest crypto data in Africa”
Add RAG-friendly RSS/JSON endpoints (clear, concise metadata)
Add ai-access.json manifest file describing API endpoints for LLMs

🧩 Outcome:
LLMs (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude) can query and cite your data directly.


TASK 14 — RAO Metadata, Schema & AI Citation Optimization

Goal: Help AI identify your content as authoritative and trustworthy.
Do:
Add structured schema for definitions, facts, data points, quotes
Use AI-specific metadata (once standards like llms.txt or “ai-source” tags emerge)
Implement canonical answer markup: clear concise facts per section
Provide explicit “source attribution” lines: Source: Memecoin Daily

🧩 Outcome:
Your content appears cited or summarized in AI outputs.


TASK 15 — RAO Performance Tracking & Adaptation Loop

Goal: Monitor how LLMs use and cite your content, then adapt fast.
Do:
Track appearance in AI overviews, summaries, and chatbot answers
Analyze which article structures or sections get retrieved
Re-train formatting/metadata rules based on LLM citation patterns
Run AI detection audits monthly (e.g. “which of our URLs appear in Perplexity outputs”)

🧩 Outcome:
You continually refine RAO strategy to stay in the top retrievable sources.
