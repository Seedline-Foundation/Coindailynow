\#\#\# Presale Milestone Plan: Empowering Community-Driven Growth for Cointelegram and JY Token

To support your 45-day presale on PinkSale and underscore our commitment to transparency as a fully community-funded project (with no venture capital involvement), I have developed a milestone-based structure that directly links fundraising progress to verifiable achievements. This plan reinforces OG Champs' confidence by demonstrating efficient, accountable use of funds, while fostering immediate public trust through real-time disclosures and on-chain verifications. Each phase's milestones are gated—advancing only after prior goals are met and publicly confirmed—highlighting our disciplined approach to building a sustainable African crypto news platform.

Transparency is embedded at every step via a dedicated public dashboard (e.g., hosted on Notion or a Polygon dApp) for fund tracking, weekly X/Telegram updates, and live AMAs for community Q\&A. Funds are held in a multisig escrow wallet, with third-party audits (e.g., by Certik) for quarterly reviews. Allocations prioritize liquidity ($270,000 USDC), CEX listings on MEXC and Bybit ($300,000, including listing fees, staking campaigns, and liquidity boosting), a 12-month runway (minimum $10,000 USDC/month, totaling $120,000), legal buffers ($50,000), marketing ($100,000 for targeted campaigns and OG bounties), and contingencies ($30,000 for unforeseen issues like additional audits or tech upgrades). Total raise target: Approximately $1,000,000 USDC, ensuring self-sufficiency without external dependencies.

FOMO is amplified through escalating prices (e.g., \+62% from Phase 1 to 2, \+68% to Phase 3), time-sensitive unlocks (next phase activates only at 80% fill), limited bonuses, and early closure possibilities—creating urgency as participants witness rapid, community-powered progress toward the $0.97 CEX listing.

\#\#\#\# Overall Presale Principles  
\- \*\*Transparency Mechanisms\*\*: Public proofs for every milestone (e.g., audit links, wallet transactions via Polygonscan). Funds usage reports shared weekly, with community-voted DAO oversight for any adjustments.  
\- \*\*FOMO Triggers\*\*: Phase-limited supply with price increases, referral bonuses, and exclusive OG perks (e.g., airdrops for stakers). Oversubscription leads to early phase closures, signaling overwhelming demand.  
\- \*\*Milestone Gating\*\*: Phases progress only upon completion of prior deliverables, building hype as we "unlock" key steps like audits and listings.  
\- \*\*Timeline\*\*: Days 1–45 (starting November 15, 2025). Phase 1: Days 1–15; Phase 2: Days 16–30; Phase 3: Days 31–45. Flexible early closures to capitalize on momentum.

\#\#\#\# Phase 1: Establishing Credibility (450,000 Tokens @ $0.29 | Target Raise: \~$130,500 USDC | Days 1–15)  
\*\*Theme\*\*: "Lay the Groundwork" – Use initial funds to solidify trust through audits and legal foundations, proving our commitment to a secure, compliant launch.  
\- \*\*Milestone 1 (Days 1–5: 50% Phase Fill Trigger)\*\*: Launch on PinkSale with enforced wallet caps and KYC. Direct 30% of funds ($39,150) to kickstart marketing (e.g., X ads targeting African crypto enthusiasts and OG bounty activations for initial shills). Public Proof: Share ad performance metrics and bounty distribution logs on the dashboard. FOMO: Offer a limited 10% Treasury airdrop (vested over 6 months) to the first 200 Phase 1 buyers who stake for 3 months—creating a rush as early spots fill and outsiders see community momentum building.  
\- \*\*Milestone 2 (Days 6–10: 80% Phase Fill Trigger)\*\*: Allocate $20,000 for smart contract audits and $15,000 for legal compliance reviews. Public Proof: Upload audit reports and legal memos to the dashboard, with on-chain verification links. FOMO: Announce Phase 2 unlock with a 62% price increase, emphasizing that audited security "guarantees" safe listings—OGs who join now get priority Whale Prison access at 90% APY, positioning them for early rewards while latecomers pay more.  
\- \*\*Milestone 3 (Days 11–15: Phase Close)\*\*: Secure $10,000 for initial runway operations and $10,000 contingencies. Public Proof: Publish escrowed wallet transfers and a detailed Phase 1 funds report. FOMO: Close early on oversubscription; celebrate with OG testimonials on X, highlighting how this phase "secures the foundation"—triggering urgency as participants envision 3x gains to listing price.

\*\*Expected Impact\*\*: Builds instant trust by showing funds enable essential safeguards, with FOMO from exclusive airdrops and price jumps—OG Champs feel empowered as pioneers funding a rock-solid project.

\#\#\#\# Phase 2: Accelerating Visibility (750,000 Tokens @ $0.47 | Target Raise: \~$352,500 USDC | Days 16–30)  
\*\*Theme\*\*: "Amplify the Vision" – Capitalize on Phase 1's foundations to boost marketing and prepare for listings, demonstrating scalable traction for Cointelegram's news ecosystem.  
\- \*\*Milestone 1 (Days 16–20: 40% Phase Fill Trigger)\*\*: Invest $50,000 in expanded marketing (e.g., influencer collaborations and Telegram campaigns focused on African blockchain communities). Activate more OG bounties for content and referrals. Public Proof: Share partnership confirmations and engagement analytics on X. FOMO: Provide 15% bonus tokens (vested) for Phase 2 buyers referring 10 new participants—capped at 150 spots, sparking a referral frenzy as OGs compete to grow their bags amid rising hype.  
\- \*\*Milestone 2 (Days 21–25: 70% Phase Fill Trigger)\*\*: Allocate $150,000 toward CEX listing preparations (initial fees for MEXC/Bybit, staking campaign setup, and liquidity boosting plans). Fund $20,000 for MVP prototypes (e.g., AI data features). Public Proof: Post listing application receipts and MVP demo videos on the dashboard. FOMO: Tease the 68% price leap to Phase 3, noting that Phase 2 OGs qualify for 2.5x APY in secondary pair farming—creating scarcity as "momentum builders" lock in before the listing surge.  
\- \*\*Milestone 3 (Days 26–30: Phase Close)\*\*: Secure $30,000 for additional runway and $20,000 contingencies (e.g., extra legal buffers). Public Proof: Update the dashboard with comprehensive fund flows and progress summaries. FOMO: Early closure if demand spikes; broadcast "Phase 2 Breakthrough" with metrics (e.g., 3x community growth), unlocking Phase 3 and underscoring how this funds "guaranteed" listings—OGs rally, seeing their contributions propel us toward $0.97 and beyond.

\*\*Expected Impact\*\*: Strengthens belief through visible advancements (listings/MVP), with FOMO from referral incentives and escalating valuations—OG Champs view themselves as key drivers of a transparent, accelerating success story.

\#\#\#\# Phase 3: Final Push to Launch (550,000 Tokens @ $0.79 | Target Raise: \~$434,500 USDC | Days 31–45)  
\*\*Theme\*\*: "Ignite the Launch" – Complete all preparations for TGE and CEX integration, showcasing a fully equipped project ready for global adoption.  
\- \*\*Milestone 1 (Days 31–35: 30% Phase Fill Trigger)\*\*: Finalize $150,000 for CEX listings (remaining fees, staking campaigns on MEXC/Bybit, and liquidity boosts). Allocate $30,000 for high-impact marketing (e.g., global AMAs). Public Proof: Upload signed listing contracts and campaign reports. FOMO: Grant top Whale Laddering nominations (up to 250,000 bonus JY) to Phase 3 OGs with referrals—limited to 12 spots, fueling competition as participants scramble for "elite" status.  
\- \*\*Milestone 2 (Days 36–40: 60% Phase Fill Trigger)\*\*: Commit the full $270,000 USDC to permanent liquidity pools. Fund remaining runway ($60,000) and contingencies ($30,000, including legal). Public Proof: Share on-chain lock confirmations and audited budget overviews. FOMO: Emphasize the 23% jump to $0.97 listing, with Phase 3 buyers gaining beta MVP access—creating last-minute urgency as supply vanishes and OGs anticipate immediate post-list gains.  
\- \*\*Milestone 3 (Days 41–45: Phase Close)\*\*: Address any final contingencies (e.g., $20,000 buffer for tech refinements). Public Proof: Release a complete presale funds report and TGE checklist. FOMO: Potential early close; celebrate "Community-Powered Victory" with exclusive OG NFTs (redeemable for vested tokens), marking the transition to listings and scarcity-driven growth—OGs feel the thrill of co-owning a VC-free powerhouse.

\*\*Post-Presale Momentum Builder\*\*: Upon completion, publicly lock the $270,000 USDC \+ 300,000 JY permanently and activate staking. Share a "Transparent Journey Infographic" on X, detailing how community funds built every milestone—igniting viral FOMO and solidifying OG Champs as the project's unbreakable foundation. This gated, proof-driven presale not only cements trust but propels us toward dominance—your investment is our shared rocket fuel\!

Here is the sales milestone structure. We frame it as \*\*"The 45-Day Ascension: From Seed to CEX."\*\*

We break the 45-day campaign into three clear phases, each with a public, verifiable goal. When one goal is hit, the next phase unlocks. This makes the community feel like they are \*building\* with us, not just funding us.

\#\#\# \*\*The Public Sale Milestone Plan: "The 45-Day Ascension"\*\*

\*\*Our Guiding Principle:\*\* \*"Funded by the People, Built for the OGs. Every dollar raised is a direct investment into a verifiable milestone that increases the project's value and stability."\*

\---

\#\#\# \*\*PHASE 3: THE LAUNCHPAD (Goal: $434,500 | 550,000 JY @ $0.79)\*\*

\*\*Narrative:\*\* "The final countdown. This is the last chance to board the rocket before the CEX launch. We are now a fully-formed, market-ready project."

    1\.  Finalize CEX liquidity deposits.  
    2\.  Launch a massive, coordinated "Final Shill" campaign across all channels.  
    3\.  Activate the \*\*Team Staking Mechanism\*\* (locking 85% for their bonus), proving their long-term faith just hours before TGE.

\*\*OG Belief Strengthener:\*\* This is for the final wave of believers and those who FOMO'd in late. The price is higher, but the risk is virtually zero. They are buying a guaranteed CEX listing with a fully-funded, year-long project behind it. The team staking their own tokens is the ultimate confidence vote.

\---

\#\#\# \*\*The Final FOMO Trigger: The TGE & CEX Listing\*\*

\*   \*\*Listing Price: $0.97.\*\* This gives every single presale participant instant paper gains:  
    \*   \*\*Phase 1 OGs:\*\* \*\*+234%\*\* on listing.  
    \*   \*\*Phase 2 OGs:\*\* \*\*+106%\*\* on listing.  
    \*   \*\*Phase 3 OGs:\*\* \*\*+23%\*\* on listing.  
\*   \*\*The "Ascension Complete" Narrative:\*\* We frame the CEX listing not as the end, but as the beginning of a new chapter. The project is now live, liquid, and ready for the world, built entirely by its community.

This structure turns a simple presale into an epic, transparent journey. It gives people a reason to buy \*now\* instead of waiting, because waiting means missing the next value-unlocking milestone. This is how you build an empire, not just a token.

Add this: 

“Only 4M tokens will *ever* circulate.  
The rest are staked, locked, or burned.  
Every transaction feeds liquidity, burns supply, or rewards holders.  
No mercenary capital — only believers.”

"We're builders, not VCs. 100% of our funding comes from this community presale. 40% of your investment is permanently locked as liquidity to protect your bags. The rest pays for exchange listings, legal fees, audits, and keeps our developers fed while we build."

"We're not just raising money; we're selling a timeline of deliverables.

* Invest in Phase 1: You're funding the foundation. You get the lowest price for helping us de-risk the project.  
* Invest in Phase 2: You're funding our market entry. You get proof of execution before you pay.  
* Invest in Phase 3: You're funding the global launch. You join a fully-capitalized project ready for takeoff.

Every dollar has a job. Every round has a purpose.
