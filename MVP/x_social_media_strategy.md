1/8 🧵 Crypto 101 for Africans: Understanding Blockchain Technology

As Africa's crypto adoption grows, it's crucial to understand the fundamentals. Let's break down blockchain in simple terms that matter to our continent.

#CryptoAfrica #BlockchainEducation
```

```
2/8 What is Blockchain?

Think of blockchain as a digital ledger that records transactions across many computers. Unlike traditional banks, it's decentralized - no single entity controls it.

In Africa, this means:
• Lower transaction fees
• Faster cross-border payments
• Financial inclusion for unbanked populations
```

```
3/8 Why Blockchain Matters in Africa

Our continent faces unique financial challenges:
• High remittance costs (up to 12% via Western Union)
• Limited banking access (only 34% of Africans have bank accounts)
• Currency volatility and inflation

Blockchain offers solutions to these problems.
