You'll have full autonomy to build your team, design comp plans, and execute against ambitious targets. This role requires a hunter mentality combined with strategic thinking - you're equally comfortable cold-calling prospects and presenting to C-level executives.

Your day-to-day will involve coaching your team, closing deals yourself (especially in early months), analyzing sales metrics, and constantly iterating on our go-to-market strategy. You'll work closely with the CEO and product team to ensure we're solving real customer problems.

Success in this role means: hitting monthly revenue targets, maintaining healthy customer acquisition costs, building a high-performing team, and establishing CoinDaily as the #1 crypto media platform for advertisers across Africa.`,

One day you might be redesigning our user onboarding flow, the next you're preparing board materials, and the following week you're launching a mental health program for the team. You need to be comfortable with ambiguity and excited by the challenge of building systems from scratch.

You'll also be the voice of the team - advocating for work-life balance, celebrating wins, addressing burnout, and ensuring remote workers feel connected. This includes overseeing our ambassador program, treating them as an extension of the core team with proper training, support, and recognition.

Success means: key initiatives ship on time, team satisfaction scores above 8/10, smooth onboarding experience for users and enterprises, and the CEO can focus on vision while you handle execution.`,

You'll need thick skin (crypto Twitter can be brutal), impeccable judgment on when to engage vs. ignore, and a sixth sense for detecting scammers and manipulators. You should be equally comfortable hosting a professional AMA as you are memeing in the Telegram.

Your north star is creating a community so valuable that people can't imagine not being part of it. This means rewarding quality contributors, creating insider benefits (alpha calls, early access, exclusive events), and ruthlessly removing low-quality actors who detract from the experience.

Success looks like: consistently high engagement rates, community-driven growth (referrals, word-of-mouth), minimal moderation incidents, positive brand sentiment, and a waiting list of people wanting to join.`,
