# CryptoAfrica News Platform Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. African-First Content Strategy
All content must prioritize African perspectives on cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Every article, analysis, and news piece should consider the African context, regulatory environment, and impact on African communities. Local partnerships with African crypto projects, exchanges, and thought leaders are mandatory for authentic coverage.

### II. AI-Powered Quality Assurance (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Every piece of content must pass through our AI pipeline: Research AI validates facts and sources; Content Generation AI assists but never replaces human insight; Review AI checks for accuracy, bias, and compliance; Translation AI ensures multilingual accessibility across major African languages. Human editorial oversight remains the final authority.

### III. Real-Time Accuracy & Transparency
Breaking news must be verified through multiple sources before publication. All articles must include source attribution, publication timestamps, and update logs. Corrections and retractions must be prominently displayed. Our custom CMS must track content lifecycle from research to publication to updates.

### IV. Multilingual Accessibility
Content must be available in English and at least 3 major African languages (Swahili, French, Arabic, Portuguese, Hausa). AI translation services must be culturally aware and crypto-terminology accurate. Local language crypto education is a priority.

### V. Data-Driven Editorial Decisions
All editorial decisions must be supported by data analysis of African crypto market trends, reader engagement metrics, and community feedback. Analytics must inform content strategy, timing, and format. Regular data reviews determine content performance and audience preferences.
