### Translation Quality Checks

**What to Verify** (if you speak the language):
1. **Meaning preserved** - Core message unchanged
2. **Cultural appropriateness** - Idioms localized
3. **Technical terms** - Crypto terms correctly translated
4. **Grammar** - Proper grammar in target language
5. **Tone** - Professional tone maintained

**If you don't speak the language**:
- Check quality score (> 0.85 acceptable)
- Look for obvious formatting issues
- Verify crypto terms not translated (Bitcoin stays "Bitcoin")
- Check links and URLs still work

### Common Translation Issues

**1. Over-literal Translation**
```
✗ Wrong: "Bull market" → "Soko la ng'ombe" (literal: cow market)
✓ Right: "Bull market" → "Soko linalopanda" (rising market)
```

**2. Untranslated Technical Terms**
```
✓ Keep: Bitcoin, Ethereum, blockchain, DeFi, NFT, ETF
✗ Don't translate: These are universal crypto terms
```

**3. Cultural Adaptation**
```
✗ Wrong: "$100 is a lot" (may not resonate in Africa)
✓ Right: "100,000 Naira is a significant amount" (localized)
```

**4. Currency Confusion**
```
✓ Include local currency: "$50,000 (approximately 40M UGX)"
✓ Use relevant exchanges: "Available on Luno and Quidax"
```

## Best Practices

### Daily Editor Routine

**Morning (Start of Shift)**
```
1. Check review queue - 5 mins
2. Review high-priority articles first - 30-60 mins
3. Batch review normal priority - 60-90 mins
4. Check revision requests - 15-30 mins
```

**Throughout Day**
```
1. Monitor new articles entering queue
2. Review revisions as they arrive
3. Provide feedback promptly
4. Collaborate with team on complex articles
```

**End of Shift**
```
1. Clear your queue (target: 0 pending)
2. Leave notes for next shift if needed
3. Review your stats for the day
4. Report any systematic issues to Super Admin
```

### Quality vs Speed

**Target Metrics**:
- **Review Time**: 10-15 minutes per article
- **Approval Rate**: 70-80% (first review)
- **Revision Rate**: 15-25%
- **Rejection Rate**: < 5%

**Balance Quality and Speed**:
```
✓ DO:
  - Use keyboard shortcuts for efficiency
  - Batch review similar articles
  - Focus on high-impact issues
  - Trust the AI quality scores (within reason)
  - Approve quickly when quality is clearly high

✗ DON'T:
  - Rush through reviews (quality suffers)
  - Over-edit (AI learns from multiple small feedbacks)
  - Perfectionism (good enough is often good enough)
  - Ignore quality metrics
  - Approve without reading
```

### Collaboration

**When to Ask for Help**:
- Unfamiliar topic (ask subject matter expert)
- Complex technical content (ask senior editor)
- Borderline quality (get second opinion)
- Policy questions (ask Super Admin)

**Team Communication**:
```
Slack Channels:
- #editors-general (questions, discussions)
- #content-review (article-specific discussions)
- #ai-feedback (report AI issues)

Tag teammates:
- @senior-editor for escalations
- @seo-specialist for complex SEO questions
- @super-admin for policy questions
```

## Tips & Shortcuts

### Keyboard Shortcuts

```
General:
  Spacebar     - Scroll down
  Shift+Space  - Scroll up
  ↑/↓          - Navigate between articles
  Esc          - Close modal/Return to queue

Review Actions:
  Cmd/Ctrl + A - Approve article
  Cmd/Ctrl + E - Edit article
  Cmd/Ctrl + R - Request revision
  Cmd/Ctrl + X - Reject article
  Cmd/Ctrl + C - Add comment

```

### Time-Saving Tips

**1. Use Review Templates**
```
Create saved responses for common feedback:
- "Grammar issues found" template
- "SEO improvements needed" template
- "Factual errors" template
- "Excellent quality" template

Access: Settings → Review Templates
```

**2. Batch Similar Articles**
```
Review all "Market Analysis" articles together
- Same evaluation criteria
- Similar structure expected
- Faster context switching
```

**3. Use Quality Score as Guide**
```
Quality > 0.90: Quick skim, likely approve (5 mins)
Quality 0.85-0.90: Moderate review (10 mins)
Quality 0.75-0.85: Thorough review (15 mins)
Quality < 0.75: Deep review, likely revision (20+ mins)
```

**4. Focus on High-Impact Issues**
```
Priority order:
1. Factual errors (CRITICAL)
2. Brand voice (HIGH)
3. Completeness (MEDIUM)
4. SEO (MEDIUM)
5. Minor grammar (LOW)
```

**5. Set Review Goals**
```
Daily targets:
- 20-30 articles reviewed
- < 2 hours total queue time
- 75%+ approval rate on first review
- 0 articles pending at end of shift
```

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

**1. Approving Without Reading**
```
✗ Problem: Approving based solely on quality score
✓ Solution: Always read the full article
Why: AI can miss context, tone issues, or subtle errors
```

**2. Over-Editing**
```
✗ Problem: Making extensive edits instead of requesting revision
✓ Solution: Minor edits OK, major changes = request revision
Why: AI learns better from revision requests with feedback
```

**3. Vague Feedback**
```
✗ Problem: "This needs work" or "Not good enough"
✓ Solution: Specific, actionable feedback with examples
Why: AI can't improve without specific guidance
```

**4. Inconsistent Standards**
```
✗ Problem: Applying different standards to similar articles
✓ Solution: Use checklists, follow guidelines consistently
Why: Inconsistency confuses AI and team
```

**5. Ignoring Context**
```
✗ Problem: Applying same standards to all content types
✓ Solution: Adjust expectations based on content type
Why: Breaking news has different requirements than evergreen content
```

### What Good Performance Looks Like

- Too high (> 90%): May be too lenient, double-check standards

**Average Review Time**: 10-15 minutes
- Too fast (< 8 min): Might be missing issues
- Too slow (> 20 min): Consider efficiency improvements

**Revision Success**: > 85%
- High success rate = effective feedback
- Low success rate = feedback might not be clear enough
